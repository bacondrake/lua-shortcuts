# Lua shortcuts

These are shortcuts for Lua that I didn't find immediately online (though I know they're there). This repo is here for my reference and not much else.

Decided to use TDD even though it's not really necessary, but it's good to practice. Maybe some day the Lua syntax changes. Running `busted` and seeing what fails is easy.
